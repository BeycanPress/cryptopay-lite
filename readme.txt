**Comparison with other services:**

***CryptoPay:***

✅ All payments reach you directly. So the whole system works as P2P (Peer to Peer).
✅ No commission is charged to sellers in any way. Only payers pay blockchain transaction fees.
✅ Since all transactions are P2P (Peer to Peer), payment confirmation times are minimal.
✅ Easily integrable to other plugins with the APIs in the plugin (integrated 16+ plugins).
✅ For example, providing services with many extra plugins such as the Donation plugin.

***Other services:***

❌ They transfer the payment first to their wallet to get a commission and then to your wallet.
❌ Payments are usually not P2P (Peer to Peer). Therefore, payment approval times are very long.
❌ The commission amounts that the service generates its own income will be deducted from your earnings.
❌ Even the fastest networks have very high payment confirmation times, as multiple transfers are made to earn commissions.
❌ Generally you can only use it for WooCommerce. To integrate with other plugins, you need a serious programming knowledge.
❌ An additional transaction fee is charged to transfer the payment from their wallet to you, and this is deducted from your earnings.
