**What advantages does CryptoPay provide you?**

As you know, virtual POS and many other payment methods deduct commission from you. The only commission here is the “gas” fee that blockchain networks charge. So the money will be transferred directly to your account. You can receive payments with all blockchain networks that have the RPC API and support the wallet that the user is currently using, and tokens and native currencies under these networks.

**Apart from that, here are the advantages that CryptoPay gives you:**

* No 3rd party service
* No withdrawal limit, fee, date
* 1-2 business days and no weekend nonsense
* The money is in your account and in use on the same day 

Are you ready to speed up the process of receiving cryptocurrency payments on WordPress with CryptoPay?

**Comparison with other services:**

***CryptoPay:***
✅ All payments reach you directly. So the whole system works as P2P (Peer to Peer).
✅ There are no additional transaction fees other than the transaction fee that the paying user pays to the Blockchain network.
✅ Since all transactions are P2P (Peer to Peer), payment confirmation times are minimal.
✅ Easily integrable to other plugins with the APIs in the plugin.
✅ For example, providing services with many extra plugins such as the Donation plugin.

***Other services:***
❌ Payments are generally not P2P (Peer to Peer). They first take the payment into their own wallet and then transfer it to you.
❌ For taking the payment to them first and then transferring it to you.
❌ The paying user pays transaction fee for Blockchain.
❌ An additional transaction fee is charged to transfer the payment from their wallet to you, and this is deducted from your earnings.
❌ The commission amounts that the service generates its own income will be deducted from your earnings.
❌ Even the fastest networks have very high payment confirmation times, as multiple transfers are made to earn commissions.
❌ Generally you can only use it for WooCommerce. To integrate with other plugins, you need a serious programming knowledge.
