**What advantages does CryptoPay provide you?**

* No 3rd party service
    * You can start getting paid as soon as you install the plugin without having any 3rd party services to start with.
* No withdrawal limit, fee, date

    * There is no need to wait for weeks or wait to get paid as in the classic financing process

**Comparison with other services:**

***CryptoPay:***

* ✅ All payments reach you directly. So the whole system works as P2P (Peer to Peer).
* ✅ No commission is charged to sellers in any way. Only payers pay blockchain transaction fees.
* ✅ Since all transactions are P2P (Peer to Peer), payment confirmation times are minimal.
* ✅ Easily integrable to other plugins with the APIs in the plugin (integrated 16+ plugins).
* ✅ For example, providing services with many extra plugins such as the Donation plugin.

***Other services:***

* ❌ They transfer the payment first to their wallet to get a commission and then to your wallet.
* ❌ Payments are usually not P2P (Peer to Peer). Therefore, payment approval times are very long.
* ❌ The commission amounts that the service generates its own income will be deducted from your earnings.
* ❌ Even the fastest networks have very high payment confirmation times, as multiple transfers are made to earn commissions.
* ❌ Generally you can only use it for WooCommerce. To integrate with other plugins, you need a serious programming knowledge.
* ❌ An additional transaction fee is charged to transfer the payment from their wallet to you, and this is deducted from your earnings.

**Are Network Supports available in Lite Version?**

Bitcoin, Solana, Tron etc. network supports are for premium only. So you can't get Bitcoin or Solana payments by buying network support add-ons. Because network supports work with the premium version.

This is because some services such as “Pay by transfer to address” run on servers that cost us monthly. So it's a one-time payment of 49 dollars. It is impossible for us to cover these costs every month.
