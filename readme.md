**What advantages does CryptoPay provide you?**

As you know, virtual POS and many other payment methods deduct commission from you. The only commission here is the “gas” fee that blockchain networks charge. So the money will be transferred directly to your account. You can receive payments with all blockchain networks that have the RPC API and support the wallet that the user is currently using, and tokens and native currencies under these networks.

**Apart from that, here are the advantages that CryptoPay gives you:**

* No 3rd party service
* No withdrawal limit, fee, date
* 1-2 business days and no weekend nonsense
* The money is in your account and in use on the same day
